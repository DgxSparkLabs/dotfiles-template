# PITFALLS

Traps hit during implementation. Read before editing the dispatcher/harness.

- **PowerShell `$HOME` is read-only.** `$HOME = ...` throws "Cannot overwrite variable HOME".
  Use `Set-Variable -Name HOME -Value … -Force`. (Tests isolate HOME via the child runner `_invoke.ps1`.)
- **Don't build child-pwsh commands by string-interpolating args.** Zero args leaked an empty-string
  argument (`dotfiles ''` → "no such repo: "). Invoke via `pwsh -NoProfile -File _invoke.ps1 @args`
  so arg boundaries (including none) are preserved.
- **Dispatcher must be source-then-call portable.** zsh chokes on bash-only `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` unless
  guarded by `[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]` first (short-circuit). Tests do `. dotfiles.sh; dotfiles …`.
- **Hook stubs / `*.sh` MUST stay LF** even on Windows (Git-Bash/sh.exe runs them) — enforced in
  `.gitattributes`. A CRLF stub fails cryptically under `sh.exe`.
- **Stderr from `[Console]::Error.WriteLine` is real process stderr**, not the PS error stream — so
  `2>&1` inside the same PS session won't capture it; the child-process `2> file` redirection does.
- **`git config --default`** (used for safe defaults) needs git ≥ 2.18 (fine on CI runners).
- **`-doctor`/`-tick`/`-show`/`-resolve` are stubs (exit 3)** until their build nodes — don't treat
  exit 3 as a bug; it's "not implemented yet".
